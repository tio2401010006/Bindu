      <p>According to authentic historical evidence written in the Babad Mengwi, it is stated that the Bindu Traditional Village has existed since 1770 during the reign of the 4th King of Mengwi who was titled I Gusti Putu Mayun Sakti. In that year, I Gusti Putu Mayun Sakti and the troops of the Mengwi Kingdom carried out an expedition to the easternmost region of the kingdom to secure the region that was being attacked by King Bun, a descendant of Sri Arya Wang Bang Pinatih. During the war that took place in the Krasan region, the troops of the Mengwi Kingdom suffered a defeat which resulted in the death of King I Gusti Putu Mayun Sakti IV.</p>

      <p>News of the king's death had reached the kingdom and because at the same time the Mengwi kingdom was controlling half of the Blambangan Kingdom which is currently known as Banyuwangi, so that there would be no government vacuum, the kingdom immediately inaugurated a new king, namely the younger brother of King I Gusti Putu Mayun Sakti IV who was given the title Ida Cokorda Munggu V.</p>

      <p>Bindu Traditional Village began to be known by the Balinese people in 1970 with the Gong Drama Putra Jenggala Bindu art performance, with famous figures or artists being I Wayan Lodra as the young king, and Gangsar or known as Mungkreg who played the role of a funny clown. While other arts also consist of kecak a cappella, palegongan and mask dance. With the potential it has, Bindu Traditional Village tried to develop tourism starting in 2006 with the presence of Furama Xclusive Villas & Resort which absorbed 70% of the workforce from the local community and the land where Furama was built was 100% owned by the local community. However, at that time the Bindu community as a whole did not understand the potential it had, only since 2015 did the community begin to realize and agree to develop tourism by making Bindu a tourist village and forming a tourism awareness group called Pokdarwis Putra Jenggala Bindu. Bindu tourism has grown tremendously every year and has survived to this day.</p>
